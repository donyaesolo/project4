		<p class ="leader_paragragh">I,Delsin Rowe, am a Conduit. I am a part of the Native American Tribe Akomash. I was a street
			artist and my brother had to arrest me multiple times. I have always been a rebel, as we were going 
			driving back to our house. A D.U.P van crashed and these 3 conduit I later discovered as Hank, Abigail,
			and Eugene.<br /> 
			
			<br /> 
			
			Hank go stuck under the rubble so I went to go get him out and I accidently absorbed his power
			allowing me to control smoke. Then D.U.P caught me and Augustine used her concrete powers to try to “interrogate
			me” before knocking me out cold<br /> 
			
			<br /> 
			 and tortured the rest of my tribe. I woke up a week later to discover that the only
			way to save my entire tribe to get her to reverse it or get the concrete power. I learned that I can’t absorb forced
			conduits but only naturally born ones. On my mission to trackdown Augustine I ran into Abigail and I helped her take 
			down drug operations and dismantle some D.U.P operations.Continued on my mission I ran into Eugene and I helped him 
			take some some D.U.P and local gangs who tried to get conduits sold back to D.U.P. We ran into Augustine with the help
			of Hank who later revealed that D.U.P held his daughter as hostages. Losing Augustine again with the help of Abigail and 
			Eugene we found her again. She told us that she purposely let conduits out so D.U.P could still have a purpose. We detained 
			her and I went back and reversed her affects on my tribe and set up a memorial for my Brother where he died. There are more 
			people like her out there. <br />
